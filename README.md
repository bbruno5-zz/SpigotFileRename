# SpigotFileRename
Utility for replace files with backup in Bukkit/Spigot servers

This plugin is made just for replace files on Bukkit/Spigot servers.
It accepts 3 arguments on the following way:

/sfr path file-to-delete new-file

Explaining:

/sfr	- make the request to plugin
path	- is the directory way
file-to-delete	- is the old file that you want to replace for other
new-file	- is the new file, of course

To make this plugin work is necessary that both files (old and new) stay on the same directory.
